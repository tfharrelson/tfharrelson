### tfharrelson ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently the scientific computing/ML engineering manager at Emerald Cloud Lab (ECL). I have an alt account (@tommyh-ECL) where I make a lot of contributions to the Symbolic Lab Language at ECL.
I am very interested in advanced computing for molecular properties, including traditional physics-based computation and newer ML/AI variants in the same space. For example, calculating
molecular energies or binding free energies with density functional theory/molecular dynamics or AI is very much my jam.

### Contributions
- Primary maintainer of [cloudcompchem](https://github.com/cloudlab-cmu/cloudcompchem).
- Maintainer of pysll package (available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pysll/)).

### About me

ðŸ”­ In my spare time, I'm currently working on:
- Graph databse for molecules using Neo4J
- Rust molecular dynamics solver that is built for ML/AI forcefields
- Python package expediting free energy perturbation workflows.
- Running a ML/AI reading club using cheminformatics to make predictions on biological datasets.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning:
- Distributed computing in Go
- Parallel processing in Rust
- ML/AI applications in Mojo
