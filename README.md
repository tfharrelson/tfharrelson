### tfharrelson 👋

I'm currently the scientific computing engineering manager at Emerald Cloud Lab (ECL). I have an alt account (@tommyh-ECL) where I make a lot of contributions to the Symbolic Lab Language at ECL.
I very much like to think about advanced computing for molecular properties, including traditional physics-based computation and newer ML/AI variants in the same space. For example, calculating
molecular energies with density functional theory or AI is very much my jam. Same with calculating binding free energies with molecular dynamics or AI. I've also dabbled in quantum computing in 
my research life, and I believe that offers a promising route for efficient computation of molecular properties once the whole "fault-tolerant" thing is figured out.

🔭 In my spare time, I'm currently working on:
- Graph databse for molecules using Neo4J
- Rust molecular dynamics solver that is built for ML/AI forcefields
- Python package expediting free energy perturbation workflows.
- Running a ML/AI reading club using cheminformatics to make predictions on biological datasets.

🌱 I'm currently learning:
- Distributed computing in Go
- Parallel processing in Rust
- ML/AI applications in Mojo
